# [`pdf_generator.py`](../../src/logic/pdf_generator.py)

This module generates a PDF document summarizing round-trip flight combinations and their details, including optional images and WhatsApp marketing text. It uses `fpdf` for layout and formatting.

## üìÑ Overview

The `PDF` class extends `FPDF` to provide custom methods for rendering round-trip flight data. The `generate_pdf` function takes a `RoundTripOptions` object and compiles a summary document, suitable for sharing or archiving.

"""
Flight filtering logic and algorithms.

This module contains the core flight filtering functionality for the flight alert system.
It processes bulk flight availability data from multiple sources, calculates costs using
mileage values and exchange rates, filters for valid round trips, and identifies the
cheapest options by cabin class and city pairings.

The main class Flight_Filter handles:
- Processing raw flight data from multiple airline sources
- Converting costs using mileage values and currency exchange
- Filtering valid round trips based on date constraints
- Finding the cheapest flight options by cabin class
- Grouping results by city pairings for easy comparison
